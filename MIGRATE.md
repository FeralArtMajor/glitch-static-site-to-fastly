# Migrate your static Glitch site to Fastly Compute

Use this repo if you have a static Glitch site you want to deploy to Fastly Compute, like a Glitch in Bio or Hello Eleventy remix.

## Set up your repo and Codespace

* Fork the migration repo: https://github.com/glitchdotcom/glitch-static-site-to-fastly/
* Export your Glitch project to your forked repo from the editor Tools menu https://help.glitch.com/s/article/Exporting-Projects-to-GitHub
* Merge your glitch branch into your main branch
* Remove a couple of files that might appear in your export and could complicate subsequent steps (make sure youâ€™re on your glitch branch if youâ€™re in GitHub):
  * `package-lock.json`
  * `shrinkwrap.yaml`

Open your project in a GitHub Codespace by clicking **Code** on your new repo and creating a new codespace on your main branch.

## Update your images

If you uploaded images to Glitch through the Assets folder youâ€™ll need to move them too:

* Download your images
* Include them in a folder in your Codespaces app 
* Update image references in yoru site code (like `src` in `img` elements) to point at your local files

## Test your site locally

Your Codespace scripts will attempt to build and run your site. You'll need files in the `build` folder to deploy to Fastly â€“ this folder should appear and be populated automatically if you're using a Glitch in Bio or Hello Eleventy remix. If you were using a static site with no `package.json` file you'll need to make the folder manually:

* Create a folder named `build`
* Copy all of your static site files into the new folder (e.g. HTML, CSS, client side JS, images)

Check your `build` folder for your output files. If they're there you're good to move forward.

Click the **ðŸ§ª Serve** button at the bottom of the Codespace. 

The Fastly tooling will attempt to scaffold a new Compute app for your project and run it in the Codespace â€“ it might take a couple of minutes but you should see a preview of your site open in the Codespace.

## Deploy your site

Ready to publish? Great, [sign up for a free Fastly developer account](https://www.fastly.com/signup/).

* Get an API Token from **Account > API Tokens > Personal Tokens > Create Token**
  * _Type_: Automation
  * _Role_: Engineer
  * _Scope_: Global (deselect the Read-only access box)
  * _Access_: All services
  * _Expiration_: Never expire
* Copy the token value

Back in your Codespace, click into the textfield at the top of the editor and type `>` to access the command palette:

* Type `secret` and select **Codespaces: Manage user secrets**
* Click **+ Add a new secret**
* Enter the name `FASTLY_API_TOKEN`
* Paste your token value and enter
  
In the notifications area at the bottom right of your codespace, you should see a prompt to reload for the new environment variable, so go ahead and click that (otherwise click the little bell ðŸ”” icon to check for the message).

Go ahead and click the **ðŸš€ Publish** button at the bottom of the Codespace editor and watch the Terminal for the output! Hopefully you see an `edgecompute.app` domain that returns your site...

## If youâ€™re using a domain through Fastly 

If you already have a domain for your site in a Fastly CDN service, you have two choices:

* Remove the domain from your CDN service and add it to your new Compute service, OR 
* Point your CDN service at your new Compute site by setting the origin host in your CDN service to your `edgecompute.app` address instead of the `glitch.me` address

Youâ€™ll find your new Compute service in your Fastly account and can access Observability data as well as other service settings.
