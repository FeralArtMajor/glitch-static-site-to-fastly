# Migrate your static Glitch site to Fastly Compute

Use this repo if you have a static Glitch site you want to deploy to Fastly Compute, like a Glitch in Bio or Hello Eleventy remix.

## Set up your repo 

* Fork the migration repo: [glitchdotcom/glitch-static-site-to-fastly](https://github.com/glitchdotcom/glitch-static-site-to-fastly/)
* Export your Glitch project to your forked repo from the editor Tools menu: [Glitch help docs export guide](https://help.glitch.com/s/article/Exporting-Projects-to-GitHub)
* Merge your `glitch` branch into your `main` branch
* Remove a couple of files that might appear in your export and could complicate subsequent steps:
  * `package-lock.json`
  * `shrinkwrap.yaml`

## Update your images

If you uploaded images to Glitch through the Assets folder youâ€™ll need to move them too:

* Download your images
* Include them in a folder in your new repo 
* Update image references in your site code (like `src` in `img` elements) to point at your local files

## Open your project in a Codespace

Open your project in a GitHub Codespace by clicking **Code** on your new repo and creating a new codespace on your main branch. The Codespace container scripts will attempt to build and run your site.

You'll find some helper buttons along the bottom of the editor that run scripts in the `_migrate` folder â€“ you might need to tweak these commands depending on your website.

## Test your site locally

In most cases you'll need your site output files to be in the `build` folder to deploy to Fastly â€“ this folder should appear and be populated automatically if you're using a Glitch in Bio or Hello Eleventy remix and will include the static assets that make up your production website (e.g. HTML, CSS, client side JS, images).

Check your `build` folder for your output files. If they're there you're good to move forward.

If you were using a static site with no `package.json` file (like a Glitch Hello Website remix) and your site files are just sitting in the root directory of your project, you'll need to make a change to the `_migrate` scripts:

* In `_migrate/serve.sh` change `./build` to `./`
* Do the same in `_migrate/publish.sh` to change `./build` to `./`

Click the **ðŸ§ª Serve** button at the bottom of the Codespace to try building and running a Compute app to deliver your website.

The Fastly tooling will attempt to scaffold a new Compute app for your project and run it in the Codespace â€“ it might take a couple of minutes but you should see a preview of your site open in the Codespace. Use the **ðŸ”Ž Split** button to show the preview side by side with your files.

## Deploy your site

Ready to publish? Great, [sign up for a free Fastly developer account](https://www.fastly.com/signup/).

* Get an API Token from **Account > API Tokens > Personal Tokens > Create Token**
  * _Type_: Automation
  * _Role_: Engineer
  * _Scope_: Global (deselect the Read-only access box)
  * _Access_: All services
  * _Expiration_: Never expire
* Copy the token value

Back in your Codespace, click into the textfield at the top of the editor and type `>` to access the command palette:

* Type `secret` and select **Codespaces: Manage user secrets**
* Click **+ Add a new secret**
* Enter the name `FASTLY_API_TOKEN`
* Paste your token value and enter
  
In the notifications area at the bottom right of your codespace, you should see a prompt to reload for the new environment variable, so go ahead and click that (otherwise click the little bell ðŸ”” icon to check for the message).

> You can alternatively add your API key in the repo **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Codespaces**.

Go ahead and click the **ðŸš€ Publish** button at the bottom of the Codespace editor, confirm you want to proceed with a `y` and watch the Terminal for the output! Hopefully you see an `edgecompute.app` domain that returns your site...

## If youâ€™re using a domain through Fastly 

If you already have a domain for your site in a Fastly CDN service, you have two choices:

* Remove the domain from your CDN service and add it to your new Compute service, OR 
* Point your CDN service at your new Compute site by setting the origin host in your CDN service to your `edgecompute.app` address instead of the `glitch.me` address

Youâ€™ll find your new Compute service in your Fastly account and can access Observability data as well as other service settings.
