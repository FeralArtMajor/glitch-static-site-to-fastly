# Deploy your static Glitch site to Fastly Compute

Use this repo if you have a static Glitch site you want to deploy to Fastly Compute, like a **Glitch in Bio** or **Hello Eleventy** remix. We'll be using the [Static Publisher](https://github.com/fastly/compute-js-static-publish) tool with some helper scripts that run in a GitHub Codespace.

> **üöß This project is an experiment in serving static sites built on Glitch from Fastly! With the Static Publisher, you can deploy an entire website to the network edge and serve it super fast from there to wherever your visitors are.**
> 
> **üö® The container scripts in this repo will attempt to automate parts of the process for you, but they won't work across all Glitch websites because there are simply too many weird and wonderful variations to accommodate. üåà üõº ü™©**
>
> **We'd love your help making this resource helpful to more people, so please share problems, suggestions, and feedback, either here in the repo [Issues](https://github.com/glitchdotcom/glitch-static-site-to-fastly/issues) or on the [community forum](https://support.glitch.com/t/project-migration-discussion/75662/). üì£**

## Set up your repo 

* Fork the repo: [glitchdotcom/glitch-static-site-to-fastly](https://github.com/glitchdotcom/glitch-static-site-to-fastly/)
* Download your Glitch project from the editor **Tools** menu: [Glitch help docs export guide](https://help.glitch.com/s/article/Downloading-Projects)
* Unzip your downloaded app ‚Äì remove some files that might appear in your export and could complicate subsequent steps, for example:
  * `package-lock.json`
  * `shrinkwrap.yaml`
  * _Check for any other files you think you can remove, including files beginning with `.` that may be hidden by default_
* Add your Glitch project files to your new repo
  * You might find this easiest by cloning your forked repo locally and copying the files over ‚Äì remember to push your changes to GitHub

> _You can alternatively export your Glitch project to GitHub and copy the files in `.devcontainer` and `_migrate` from this repo into yours, however that will be a little more awkward if we make improvements to the flow and you want to pull them into your repo._

### Static sites with no build process

If your site does not contain a `package.json` file, for example if it's a **Hello Website** remix, you'll need to add a couple of files to use a build process which will add your files to an output folder:

Add a `package.json` file:

```json
{  
  "scripts": {
    "start": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "serve": "vite preview"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "vite": "^4.0.0"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": "16.x"
  }
}
```

And a `vite.config.js` file:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig(async ({ command, mode }) => {
  return {
    build: {
      outDir: "build"
    }
  };
});
```

## Update your images

If you uploaded images to Glitch through the Assets folder you‚Äôll need to move them separately:

* Download your images
* Include them in a folder in your new repo 
* Update image references in your site code (like `src` in `img` elements) to point at your local files

## Open your project in a Codespace

Open your project in a GitHub Codespace by clicking **Code** on your new repo and creating a new codespace on your branch. 

![create codespace](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/078484b0-af79-45e8-8f4f-4a3ef045b185)

The Codespace container scripts will attempt to build and run your site. Use the **üîé Split** button to show the preview side by side with your files.

![running local app](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5914cee9-de5d-4c42-91ed-fdf93cbf4b48)

You'll find some helper buttons along the bottom of the editor including **üöÄ Publish** which runs a script in the `_migrate` folder ‚Äì you might need to tweak these commands depending on your website.

> üí´ _Using an older Glitch in Bio remix and seeing an endless reload? Remove the `server` object from your `vite.config.js` file and hopefully that'll sort it ‚Äì this was an optimization we included for editing in Glitch._

## Build your site locally

In most cases you'll need your site output files to be in the `build` folder to deploy to Fastly ‚Äì this folder should appear and be populated automatically if you're using a **Glitch in Bio** or **Hello Eleventy** remix and will include the static assets that make up your production website (e.g. HTML, CSS, client side JS, images).

Check your `build` folder for your output files. If they're there you're good to move forward.

### Sites with a different build process or output folder

If you're having trouble getting the build process to complete, check out your project `package.json` file for the relevant commands to try, and any config files you have for the framework you're using, in case the output folder is named something different ‚Äì¬†if it is, change the `_migrate/publish.sh` and `_migrate/serve.sh` scripts to point at the relevant folder instead of `build`.

## Test your Compute app

You can try running the Compute app you'll be deploying to Fastly in the Codespace before publishing using the script in `_migrate/serve.sh`. Change `build` in the script if your output folder is different ‚Äì run it from the Terminal:

```
bash _migrate/serve.sh
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è _Note that you can only run the test server once per session in a Codespace because it'll attempt to reuse the same port number._

The Fastly tooling will attempt to scaffold a new Compute app for your project and run it in the Codespace ‚Äì it might take a couple of minutes but you should see a preview of your site open in the Codespace. 

You should see the preview URL change to reflect the port number for your Compute app which will be `7676`.

Your Compute app code will be in the `compute-js` folder, and the `fastly.toml` file will update with your Fastly service details as you execute the commands.

> üèóÔ∏è _If your Compute app doesn't successfully serve the first time it's best to delete the `compute-js` folder before trying again._

## Deploy your site

Ready to publish? Great, [sign up for a free Fastly developer account](https://www.fastly.com/signup/).

* Get an API Token from **Account > API Tokens > Personal Tokens > Create Token**
  * _Type_: Automation
  * _Role_: Engineer
  * _Scope_: Global (deselect the Read-only access box)
  * _Access_: All services
  * _Expiration_: Never expire
* Copy the token value

Back in your Codespace, click into the textfield at the top of the editor and type `>` to access the command palette:

* Type `secret` and select **Codespaces: Manage user secrets**
* Click **+ Add a new secret**
* Enter the name `FASTLY_API_TOKEN`
* Paste your token value and enter
  
In the notifications area at the bottom right of your codespace, you should see a prompt to reload for the new environment variable, so go ahead and click that (otherwise click the little bell üîî icon to check for the message).

> You can alternatively add your API key in the repo **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Codespaces**.

![reload codespace](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54bd53b2-a8a6-43df-979b-2bed6a980bd8)

> _When you reload your codespace you might see an error about a port already being in use ‚Äì this happens in Vite projects like Glitch in Bio. You can fix it by removing the `server` object from your `vite.config.js` file, or you can just ignore it._ üíÖ

Go ahead and click the **üöÄ Publish** button at the bottom of the Codespace editor, confirm you want to proceed with a `y` and watch the Terminal for the output! 

![follow link](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72ab3767-aaa1-4fab-ab97-103b407ff400)

Hopefully you see an `edgecompute.app` domain that returns your site ‚Äì go ahead and open it!

![deployed app](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6c2210b-bdf0-4256-bcd9-67052c15d9f9)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note that if you go through this flow for more than one site you‚Äôll need to change the KV Store name in your `_migrate/publish.sh` script to avoid duplicates ‚Äì you also won't be able to use the same name for more than one Fastly service, so make sure your `package.json` files use unique names before deploying.

## Working on your project

If you make edits to your project in the Codespace, remember to commit them to your GitHub repo as the Codespace will only store them for a limited period of time. If you make edits to the repo, you'll need to sync your Codespace to pull them in. Check out the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/using-source-control-in-your-codespace) for tips on working with your repository in a Codespace.

## If you‚Äôre using a domain through Fastly 

If you already have a domain for your site in a Fastly CDN service, you have two choices:

* Remove the domain from your CDN service and add it to your new Compute service, OR 
* Point your CDN service at your new Compute site by setting the origin host in your CDN service to your `edgecompute.app` address instead of the `glitch.me` address

You‚Äôll find your new Compute service in your Fastly account and can access Observability data as well as other service settings.
